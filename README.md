# Projects, tools, and standards

An annotated list of projects, tools, and standards related to the representation of historical time.

## Calendars / dating systems

* **Buddhist Studies Time Authority Databases**

    These databases integrate information from various projects at the Library and Information Center at Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts. By providing information on Chinese calendar dates they help with disambiguation and referencing of dates.

    * [Documentation of the Time Authority Database](https://wiki.dila.edu.tw/pages/法鼓佛教學院時間規範資料庫說明：Notes_on_the_DDBC_Time_Authority_Database)
    
## Periods

* **iDAI ChronOntology**

    iDAI.chronontology (short form: ChronOntology) is a web service that connects chronological terms, i.e. epochs, periods and events, with dating information. Hosted by the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) and part of the iDAI.welt, ChronOntology is an internet research tool for the Archaeology and Altertumswissenschaft (ancient studies and literature). Anyone can refer to its data, and anyone can add their additional project-specific or research-specific data on request. At the DAI, ChronOntology is the standard gazetteer for period names. Like the iDAI.gazetteer for place names, it serves as a norm data vocabulary for other information systems at the DAI and links them with other global time gazetteer systems.

## Modeling tools

* **ChronoLog Chronological Toolkit**

    ChronoLog is a software tool for chronological research in archaeology. It allows users to build complex models featuring chronological sequences, bounds on dates and durations, and various types of synchronisms. The software automatically checks the validity of such models, and computes the tightest possible chronological ranges for the date and duration of each chronological object in the  model.

* **ChronoVis: Paintbox**

    A no-code graphical interface for generating temporal data visualizations, designed by the humanities for the humanities.

## Standards

* **CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model**

    The CIDOC CRM is a formal ontology intended to facilitate the integration, mediation and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information and similar information from other domains. It includes a set of properties relating to temporal entities supporting the documentation of dates as time-spans or dimensions, mereological relations between temporal entities, as well as a complete suite of topological relations.
